# 3D-Printer-Writing-Extension
This project will take in some text provided by the user and spit out a gcode file. This gcode file can be sent to a 3d printer and using a printed attachment, the printer will write what the user imputed on paper. The goal is to learn more about file conversion and computer graphics stuff. The main crux of the project will be converting vector images into gcode instructions. This project does not have a good user experience and is not user friendly or very useful, but it is very cool. With that said, there might be a website in which a user can type stuff into a textbox and after a long loading time, (due to the most likely very inefficient program) the user will be able to download a gcode file. Or there will be a bunch of code in a public git repository that ppl can download.
